User Guide

Initial Configuration
---------------------

Login
~~~~~

There is no public section in the ZiSoft Security Awareness Application.
Any user wishing to perform any kind of operation on the system will
have to login first.

.. figure:: https://gitlab.com/zisoft-public/resources/raw/master/login.png
   :alt: Zisoft Login

   Zinad Logo
The system comes with two predefined users

It is extremely important to change the password of your admin user once
you have installed the application. To do so...

1. login with the default admin username and password,
2. then go to the “Administrator” drop down on the top bar |Zinad Logo|
3. navigate to “settings” => users
4. find the admin user, then click on “Password”
5. enter the password twice and click "Save".
6. if successful, you will see a confirmation message

The first thing you need to do after installing the system is to head to
the “settings” area and add your organization information. This is a
system-wide information that will be used throughout the application.

To change your settings...

1. navigate to "Administration" => "Settings"
2. click on “Edit” then set your application URL and Company name. Make
   sure to include the protocol and the fully qualified domain name in
   the Host field. This has to be the same URL from which you are
   serving your awareness application. For example: Host Name should be
   https://big-company.com/awareness. Example of company name is ”Big
   Company”.
3. click save and wait for the confirmation message

Manually Adding Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Zisoft allows you to add users either manually or by importing them from
a CSV file or by integration with LDAP. To add users manually,

1. navigate to the "Administrator" => "Settings" => "Users" page
2. Click on "+ User"
3. Enter the user details and click "Save"

Note that you need to choose the types of newly added user. Users can be
of one of the following types

-  Administrator: This is a user with full access to the system. This
   user can create and manage campaigns and other users, send emails,
   view reports and so on.
-  Moderator: This is a user with the same authorities as Administrator,
   However, this user can't see the campaigns created by any
   Administrator or any other Moderator. Moderators also don't have
   access to some system settings like LDAP servers or Email server.
-  User: This is the normal user who can only view lessons and complete
   exams\*

Resetting a Password for Another User
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As an Administrator, you can reset the password of any other non-admin
user. To do so...

1. navigate to the users page
2. click on "password" next to the respective user
3. set the password twice, then click save

Importing Users from LDAP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Awareness can import your LDAP users automatically, but you will need to
configure an LDAP server first. To do so...

1. Navigate to "Administrator" => "Settings" => "LDAP Servers"
2. Click on "+ LDAP Server"
3. Enter all the server information
4. Click "Save"

To set the password of the LDAP server, there is a separate action for
it

1. Click on "Password" of the respective server
2. Enter the password
3. Click save

Once a server is configured, you will need to click on "Import" to pull
all the users from the LDAP server and create respective users for them
in the system

Note: Clicking on "Import" does not import users immediately. This
action spawns a background process called "Job" that will do the actual
importing. You will see that the number of users on the system starts to
increase gradually until all users are imported. You can check
background job status in the "Administrator" => "Settings" =>
"Background Jobs" page

Also note that any user imported will LDAP will automatically by
assigned role "User" not "Administrator". An existing administrator will
need to change a specific user role to "Administrator" if they wish to
give them that privilege.

Training Campaign
-----------------

A campaign is like a course or a semester. You start a campaign when you
have some lessons that you need to distribute to your users. The
campaign holds information about the lessons, the users, start date, end
date, exams, and so on.

To create a campaign...

1. Navigate to "Administrator" => "Training" => "Training Campaigns".
2. Click "+ Campaign"
3. Enter the campaign information
4. Click Save

Note that the choice of having an exam in the campaign is final and can
not be changed once the campaign has been created. This is because
changing the exam will result in wrong values in the reports because
some of your users might have already submitted the old exams that you
have changed. More on exams later

Now, you need to add lessons to the campaign

1. Click on "Lessons" next to the desired campaign
2. From the menu, select all applicable Lessons
3. Click Save

Once the campaign has lessons, it is time to add users to it.

1. Click on "Users" next to the desired Campaign
2. Select all applicable users
3. Click "Save"

Your campaign is now ready. Any user who signs into the "Awareness"
system will be able to see that they are required to complete those
lessons (and possibly an exam if you configured one) in order to pass
the campaign.

Exams
~~~~~

An exam is a collection of questions from different lessons. You can
have an exam with one question from every lesson or an exam with two
questions from a each lesson related to passwords or any combination of
questions you like. The questions in the exam has no direct relation
with the lessons of the training campaigns. This means that it is up to
you to make sure your exam does not include questions that has not been
covered in the campaign.

Exams can also be used without any training lessons. For example, you
may wish to start a training campaign with only an exam and no lessons
at the beginning of your awareness initiative to measure your employees'
security awareness and tailor the upcoming training campaigns
accordingly.

To create a new exam and use it in a campaign...

1. Navigate to "Administrator" => "Training" => "Exams"
2. Click on "+ Exam"
3. Enter the name of your Exam
4. Click "Save"

Now that you created the empty exam, you should be able to add lessons
to it.

1. Next to the exam that you just created, click on "Lessons"
2. Click on "+ Lesson" in the sub area
3. Choose the lessons that you want to add to the Exam
4. Click "Save"

With the Exam ready, you can now navigate to "Training Campaigns" and
chose this exam when creating a new campaign.

Note: Exams are final; you can add an exam to a new campaign, but you
can not change it or remove it from a campaign once it is added.

Custom Lessons, Quizzes and Exams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ZiSoft Awareness comes with a rich set of predefined questions and
answers, but sometimes you might want to create your own questions. Not
only that, you can even define a new lesosn altogether, for your
compliance training for example. To create your own questions in an
existing lesson...

1. Navigate to "Administrator" => "Training" => "Lesson"
2. Open the desired lesson, then click on "Questions"
3. Click no "+ Add Question"
4. Add your question
5. Click on save
6. Then click on "Answers" on the newly created question
7. Add the desired list of answers, specifiying if it is correct or not
   for each answer.

To create your own lesson first, click on "+ Lesson" first, name the
lesson, then follow the same steps above.

Email Server Settings
---------------------

An email server is used when ever you are sending emails from the
Awareness system. You can configure one server for every kind of emails
or a separate server for each kind.

The "Awareness" system sends the following kinds of Emails

-  Training: This is an email you send in the context of a specific
   training campaign. For example, an email saying "Dear user, you have
   been invited to a campaign 'Q1'", and so on. More on this later in
   this guide
-  Phishing: This is an email you send to your users to verify their
   vulnerability to phishing emails, something like an attack simulator.
   More on this later in this guide.
-  Tips: This is an email you send to your users to advise them on best
   security practices and behaviors. For example "Make sure to remember
   to lock your PC before you leave the office". You can send tips
   everyday, every week, every month, or so on.
-  General: Any other email you send that is not of the above types is
   called "general"

To configure a server...

1. navigate to "Administrator" => "Emails" => "Email Servers"
2. click on "+ Email Server"
3. add all server information like host, port, and authentication
   methods
4. click "Save"

Note that, like any other password in "Awareness", there is a separate
action for setting this password. To set email password ...

1. click on "Password" next tot the respective email server
2. enter the password twice
3. click "Save"

Sending Emails to Campaign Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Normally, you would need to send a notification email to all users in a
given campaign to tell them that they have been enrolled in the campaign
and need to start completing the lessons. To do so, we will use the
"Email Engine".

"Awareness" system sends a variety of emails. Sending emails is done
also in campaigns. An email campaign is different from a training
campaign, but serves the same purpose. It gathers the information needed
to send an email to a target set of users.

1. Navigate to "Administrator" => "Email" => "Email Campaign"
2. Click on "+ Email Campaign", enter a name for the email campaign,
   then click "Save"
3. Click on "Send" next to the campaign that you just created
4. From the "context" menu, select "Training"
5. Find the training campaign that you need to send emails for and click
   next
6. Choose the email server and email template that you need to use
7. You will see a list of "place holders" that appear below the template
   name. You can use them to override any placeholder manually. Usually,
   you will need to leave them alone.
8. Click "Send"

Note: like importing users from LDAP, sending emails is a lengthy
operation. Imagine sending to ten thousand users. For this reason,
clicking on "Send" does not actually send the emails. Instead, it
creates a background process (called Job) that does the actual sending.
You can check background job status in the "Administrator" => "Settings"
=> "Job" page

"Awareness" comes bundled with a set of email templates that you can
use, or you can build your own template adding your own logo and
signatures and so on. See "Adding Email Templates"

Including Files in Emails
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Admins can add links in the email templates. Links can point to files in
an external storage on the internet, an internal storage in your
origanization, or inside the awareness system server itself. See "Adding
Email Templates" below.

NOTE: ZiSoft does not currently support attaching files inside the
emails themselves. All files, images, logos, etc., must be included via
links.

Attending Lessons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you received the campaign notification email, you should be able to
view the lessons in this campaign by visiting the home page of the
Awareness System e.g https://awareness.my-company.com/ (or
https://yourcompany.zisoftonline.com if you have a cloud deployment).
The home page will list all campaigns that you are added to in
chronological order.

.. figure:: https://gitlab.com/zisoft-public/resources/raw/master/home.png
   :alt: Zisoft Home

   Zisoft Home
Each campaign listing will show how many lessons you have completed and
how many lessons you have remaining to be completed. If the admin has
added an exam, you will see the status of the exam and your score if you
have passed. Click on each lesson to go to the classroom page to attend
the lesson and complete its quiz.

.. figure:: https://gitlab.com/zisoft-public/resources/raw/master/lesson.png
   :alt: Zisoft Lesson

   Zisoft Lesson
If you are a non admin user, this is the only thing you will need to do
on the awareness system.

Adding Email Templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Navigate to "Administrator" => "Email" => "Templates"
2. Click on "+ Email Template"
3. Enter the template name, content, and so on
4. Choose the context in which this template will be used
5. Click Save

Emails are sent in contexts. For example, "Training", "Phishing",
"News", etc. Choosing the right context allows the email engine to
process template place holders correctly.

Template Placeholders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Embedded inside template content, you can find texts similar to
{first\_name}, {last\_name}, {campaign\_name}, etc. These are called
"place holders". Placeholders are special texts that get replaced by the
email engine at the time of sending the email.

For example, if you have a template that reads...

``Dear {last_name}, You have been invited to campaign {campaign_name}``

the end user will receive an email that reads...

``Dear john, You have been invited to campaign "First Quarter Password Awareness"``

The list of available email template place holders is

-  {first\_name}: First name of the receiver
-  {last\_name}: Last name of the receiver
-  {username}: Username of the receiver
-  {link}: The special tracking number used in phishing Emails
-  {company\_name}: The name of the company configured in the settings
   section
-  {email}: Email address of the receiver
-  {host}: The host address configured in the settings section
-  {phishpot\_title}: The name of a phishpot campaign
-  {campaign\_title}: The name of a training campaign

More tags will be added in upcoming releases

Phishing
--------

Conducting a phishing campaign requires coordination between several
parts of the application

First, you need to create a container that serves as a record of this
campaign. This is called the "Phishpot" or the "Phishing Campaign". Each
phishing campaign designates one "Phishing Page". The phishing page is a
web page that will be the target of the emails sent to the users. In
other words, when your users click on the phishing email, this is the
page they will be taken to. The Awareness system comes pre packaged with
a set of phishing pages to use, and you can define and use your own if
you want.

Second, you need to send the email. A phishing email is just a regular
email sent like any other email, but with one small difference: it
contains a special tracking code similar to
"http://coolwebsite.com?link=hdhfey37ehfbf". This link is specific to
each user and helps the system track which of the users have fallen
victim for this phishing campaign and which haven't. The Awareness
system also comes packed with phishing emails that you can use out of
the box, and you can define your own if you want.

The following section describe how to configure campaigns, emails and
pages.

Phishing Campaign
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a new phishing campaign ...

1. Navigate to "Administrator" => Phishing => Phishing campaigns
2. Click on "+ Phishing Campaign"
3. Enter the name of the campaign
4. Choose the phishing page
5. Click save

Now that the campaign is created, you need to add users to it

1. Click on "Users" next to the campaign you want
2. A sub area will open. Click on "+ Add User"
3. Select the users you want to add to the campaign
4. Click save

Phishing Email Templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Awareness system comes pre-packaged with phishing email templates.
You can use those templates out of the box. If you you need to define
your own, you need to create your own phishing email template. To add a
phishing email template is similar to adding any email template but you
choose the type of the email to be "Phishing". Within the email body,
you need to insert a link that directs to "{host}/execute/page/{link}".
Before sending the email, the engine will replace the two special tags
{host} and {link} with the host you entered in your settings and the
special link that is specific to each user as described in "Phishing"
section above

Phishing Pages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The system comes pre-packaged with phishing pages. To add a phishing
page of your own ...

1. Navigate to "Administration" => "Phishing" => "Phishing Pages"
2. Click on "+ Phishing Page"
3. Enter the name of the page and the content
4. Click save

Sending Phishing Emails
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To send phishing emails, you need to setup some pre-requisites, namely
"Email Server" and DNS Name.

1. Email Server: You need to setup an email server with an email account
   that will be used to send the phishing emails. The name of this
   account should be related to the phishing campaign. For example, if
   your company is called "Company-Inc" and you are using the "Linked
   In" phishing campaign, then your should create a user called
   "linkedin@company-inc.com".
2. DNS Name: When your users click on the phishing emails in the links,
   they will be redirected to a phishing page. If this page's name is
   called "awareness.company-inc.com", the users might be aware they are
   being tested. Instead, the page should be named something like
   "linkedin.company-inc.com"

In the Cloud deployment, ZiSoft can provide an account like
"linkedin@zisoftonline.com" and can provide a DNS like
"linkedin.zisoftonline.com". If you need more control, you will need to
setup your own domain name and email server.

When you have the above pre-requisites, you can use the Email Campaign
tool as described above.

Email Attachments in Phishing Campaigns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This feature allows administrators to add an email attachment in the
outgoing phishing simulation emails. This is a critical feature that
enabled Awareness administrators to measure the level of security
awareness in the organization, and whether or not they can be tricked
into opening an attachment in a phishing email.

- Subject: The subject line that will appear in the email header.
- Language: The language of the email template, which can be used to fill the email template with the data in the preferred language, i.e. English or Arabic name of the Campaign or Quiz.
- Type: The context for which the template will be used. There are many contexts, as the email templates can be used by many components in the Awareness platform. Therefore, its crucial to set the type to “Certificate” for “certificate email template” and “Certificate Notification” for “Notification email template”, so that the newly created email template can be used in the Certificate Configurations as the next section explains.


Edit an Existing Certificate and Notification Template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For edit an existing certificate, It’s required to search for “Certificate” in the filter text box, and then a list of all available certificates templates will be appear.
To change an existing certificate, identify the template by its title, and then click on “Edit” to open the template and change its content using the same method used to create a new one.

Certificate Placeholders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The certificate templates support a collection of placeholders that can be used to dynamically replace them with actual data about the user or the certificate context that is used. Below a list of the supported placeholders, you can easily add them when you create or edit a certificate email template. Placeholder Interpretation

Importing Users Data from CSV file
----------------------------------

This feature allows administrators to import a list of users and to
create their accounts on the Awareness platform using a Comma-Separated
Values file (CSV). Unlike the SSO login, the user data that is imported
from, the option to import users from a CSV file will initialize the
profiles for the users, by creating their accounts, with a predefined
username, email, first name, last name, department, language, and
possibly will initialize a password for the user as well.

Importing Users Data from LDAP Server
-------------------------------------

This feature is a mix between the CSV feature and the SSO with Active
Directory feature. It allows the administrators to define an LDAP server
for authentication and import users from it similar to importing the
users from CSV file, but with an exception; the user profiles will be
created by querying the LDAP server at import time, but no passwords
will be set for those users, since the actual passwords that users will
submit is their original organizational accounts passwords. The
awareness will then send a server-to-server request to the LDAP server
to authenticate, but no tokens will be received only an identifier that
the credentials are valid or not. ### Feature Navigation > Admin

   to return to the LDAP Servers list.
4. Locate the added LDAP server by watching the one with the defined
   Title field, and the click on Password.
5. The password is the Bind Password, which the awareness will use to
   authenticate using it with the Bind DN, so that the Awareness
   platform can have authenticated access to read the LDAP server
   entries and import the users.

LDAP Configuration Option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

LDAP can be enabled or disabled by the IT support. If the LDAP is
disabled, then you cannot perform the following actions:

-  Create LDAP Server
-  If already created before disabling LDAP, then you cannot import the
   users
-  If LDAP users already imported before LDAP was disabled, then all
   LDAP users will not be able to login to the Awareness platform

LDAP User Source

Reporting
---------

ZiSoft Awareness uses a very powerful reporting engine called
`MetaBase <https://www.metabase.com>`__. MetaBase allows you to run very
specific and customized queries against your ZiSoft Awareness instance.
For example, you can create a question asking "What is the percentage of
people who passed campaign 'Q1'" or "What is the progress in the
percentage of success between last campaign and this campaign". After
asking your question, you can organize those questions in "Dashboards".
This dashboard is "Live" meaning that it will find the most recent
information in the database and present it to you whenever you refresh
the page. This dashboard can be saved and loaded anytime.

ZiSoft Awareness comes with example dashboards that contain some example
questions about training campaigns and phishing campaigns. You can
customize it or you can copy paste from it to build your own campaign.
If you would like help with that, talk to support@zisoftonline.com.

Viewing Dashboards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To view the dashboards...

1. click on your user-name on the top-right corner of the screen
2. click on Admin Dashboards
3. Choose the dashboard from the drop down
4. Add the appropriate parameters to the selected dashboard (e.g. the
   campaign id or the phishpot id)

Single Sign On (SSO)

2. If you login for the first time with the SSO, you will be required to
   choose the SSO option that you prefer to use

   image

3. After choosing the preferred SSO option, you will be redirected to
   the SSO server login page, where you should enter your organizational
   credentials, and after that completes, you will be redirected back to
   the Awareness platform.

   image

4. After you return to the awareness, the SSO server will send a special
   parameter (token) which the awareness will use to exchange some
   messages with the SSO server, that will in the end allow the
   awareness to get the username, email, first name, and last name of
   the user as a minimum so that a profile within the Awareness platform
   can be initialized.

5. The next time you try to login to the Awareness platform using your
   organizational credentials, you will be moved directly from Step 1 to
   Step 4, and if your session is saved on the SSO server side, then you
   may be redirected from Step 1 to Step 5 directly.

Note:-

::

        For user login with SSO option, the “Change Password” tab will not appear in the user profile page, as SSO user cannot change his password from Awareness Application 
        For user login with SSO option, the “Forgot Password” link will not appear in login page, as SSO user cannot change his password from Awareness Application 

4. **SSO User Source**

5. For the user created using SSO option the source of the user will set
   to OAuth2, and you can review this by:

    Admin privileges are needed to access this feature

    C --> D(Users)

2. Search the list of users and and locate users with Source as
   “OAuth2”.

   (Password) button, because the authentication is forwarded to the
   external SSO server.
