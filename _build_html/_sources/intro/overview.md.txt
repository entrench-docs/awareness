## Learning Management System

Think of Zisoft LMS as your own private 'Coursera' or 'Udemy'. You use it to create courses
complete with videos, slides, quizzes, exams, and certificates. Then you assign the courses
to your employees and monitor their training in real-time. You can assign as many lessons
you need to as many employees you need, and you can generate comprehensive reports in
a variety of formats and charts.


## Security Awareness Content

On top of the LMS, Zisoft offers Zinad's security awareness content. These are predefined
courses and exams that target security related topics. It offers 'Email Security', 'Data
Leakage', 'Device Security', 'Browser Security', among many others.

## Email Phishing Simulator


You are under a constant stream of phishing attacks whether you believe it or not. If you
want to make sure, try our phishing simulator. With this simulator, you can send a
'controlled' and 'harmless' phishing email to a group of your organization users, and you
can monitor in real time how many of them fall victim for those attacks. With the simulator,
you can generate a report that tells you the percentage of your organization who is prone to
phishing attacks, rank the departments according to their vulnerability, and conduct
competitions for the employees to encourage them to be better at spotting phishing
attacks.
